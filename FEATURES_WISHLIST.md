- Keep going until you hit a mine
- **No second chances** - one mine = game over

**Progression:**

Level 3: 12×12 = 144 tiles, 29 mines (20%)
Level 4: 14×14 = 196 tiles, 44 mines (22%)
Level 5: 16×16 = 256 tiles, 58 mines (23%)
Level 6: 18×18 = 324 tiles, 81 mines (25%)
...continues until death
```
